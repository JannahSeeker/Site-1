Which is one thing, I'm vowing to never let happen this year. This year, I really want to change myself for the better. Yes, I've said the mulitple times. But this time, feels truly diffent, special even. \nI personally desire to exceed by bounds. I need to be the best C++ programmer in my hemsiphere. I want to become articulate and well-spoken. I want to devour more books, increase my surface lexicon and all that jazz. I want to better my quranic memorization... So many goals and dreams, yet lacking real structure and execution. Well this is going to change in 365 days. Yours truly.",
